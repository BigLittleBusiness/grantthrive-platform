## ðŸ“ˆ **ROI CALCULATION FORMULAS**

### **Primary ROI Calculation:**
```
ROI = (Annual Benefits - Annual Costs) / Annual Costs Ã— 100

Where:
Annual Benefits = Staff Time Savings + Operational Savings + Technology Savings
Annual Costs = GrantThrive Subscription + Add-on Features
```

### **Payback Period Calculation:**
```
Payback Period = Total Implementation Cost / Monthly Net Savings

Where:
Monthly Net Savings = (Annual Benefits - Annual Costs) / 12
```

### **5-Year Net Present Value:**
```
NPV = Î£(Annual Net Benefits / (1 + Discount Rate)^Year) - Initial Investment

Where:
Discount Rate = 8% (typical for government technology investments)
Annual Net Benefits = Annual Benefits - Annual Costs
```
