# Issue 3: User Authentication System

**Title:** [FEATURE] Implement user authentication and authorization  
**Labels:** enhancement, security, high-priority  
**Milestone:** Phase 1: Foundation  

## Description
Implement comprehensive user authentication system with role-based access control for different user types (applicants, council staff, administrators).

## User Story
As a user, I want to securely register and log in to the platform so that I can access appropriate features based on my role.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] User registration with email verification
- [ ] Secure login with JWT tokens
- [ ] Role-based access control
- [ ] Password reset functionality
- [ ] Session management

## Technical Considerations
- JWT token implementation
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Email verification system
- Role and permission models

## Implementation Details
### Authentication Flow
1. User registration with email verification
2. Secure login with JWT token generation
3. Token validation middleware
4. Role-based route protection

### Security Features
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- JWT token expiration and refresh
- Rate limiting for login attempts
- Email verification for new accounts

### User Roles
- **Applicant**: Can apply for grants, access community features
- **Council Staff**: Can manage grant programs, review applications
- **Administrator**: Full system access, user management

## API Endpoints to Implement
- `POST /auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /auth/login` - User login
- `POST /auth/refresh` - Token refresh
- `POST /auth/logout` - User logout
- `POST /auth/verify-email` - Email verification
- `POST /auth/forgot-password` - Password reset request
- `POST /auth/reset-password` - Password reset

## Dependencies
- Issue #1 (Project Setup) - requires backend setup
- Issue #2 (Database Schema) - requires user models

## Estimated Effort
- Authentication endpoints: 4-5 hours
- JWT implementation: 2-3 hours
- Email verification: 2-3 hours
- Password reset: 2-3 hours
- Role-based access: 2-3 hours
- Testing: 2-3 hours

**Total: 14-20 hours**
