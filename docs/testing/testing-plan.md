# GrantThrive Testing Plan

This document outlines the testing plan for the GrantThrive platform. The goal of this plan is to ensure that the platform is reliable, secure, and meets the needs of its users.

## 1. Testing Levels

### 1.1. Unit Testing

Unit tests will be written for all backend and frontend components. These tests will be automated and will be run as part of the continuous integration (CI) process.

### 1.2. Integration Testing

Integration tests will be written to test the interactions between different components of the platform. These tests will also be automated and will be run as part of the CI process.

### 1.3. End-to-End Testing

End-to-end tests will be written to test the entire platform from the user's perspective. These tests will be automated using a tool like Cypress or Selenium.

### 1.4. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

UAT will be conducted with a group of representative users to ensure that the platform meets their needs and is easy to use.

## 2. Testing Types

### 2.1. Functional Testing

Functional testing will be conducted to ensure that all features of the platform work as expected.

### 2.2. Performance Testing

Performance testing will be conducted to ensure that the platform can handle a high volume of traffic and data.

### 2.3. Security Testing

Security testing will be conducted to identify and address any security vulnerabilities in the platform.

### 2.4. Usability Testing

Usability testing will be conducted to ensure that the platform is easy to use and understand.

## 3. Test Environments

### 3.1. Development Environment

The development environment will be used by developers to write and test their code.

### 3.2. Staging Environment

The staging environment will be a replica of the production environment and will be used for testing before deploying to production.

### 3.3. Production Environment

The production environment is the live environment that is used by customers.

## 4. Test Schedule

Testing will be conducted throughout the development lifecycle. Unit and integration tests will be run continuously as part of the CI process. End-to-end tests will be run before each release. UAT will be conducted before major releases.

## 5. Roles and Responsibilities

- **Developers:** Responsible for writing and running unit and integration tests.
- **QA Engineers:** Responsible for writing and running end-to-end tests, performance tests, and security tests.
- **Product Managers:** Responsible for conducting UAT.
