## Prerequisites and Requirements {#prerequisites}

### AWS Account Requirements

Before beginning the deployment process, ensure you have access to an AWS account with appropriate permissions and billing configured. The deployment requires administrative access to create and configure various AWS services including EC2, RDS, S3, CloudFront, Route 53, and IAM resources.

Your AWS account must have sufficient service limits to accommodate the GrantThrive infrastructure. The default limits for most services are adequate, but you may need to request increases for EC2 instances, RDS instances, or Elastic IP addresses depending on your expected usage patterns and scaling requirements.

Billing alerts should be configured to monitor costs during deployment and ongoing operations. The estimated monthly cost for a production GrantThrive deployment ranges from $200-500 USD depending on usage patterns, data storage requirements, and selected instance types.

### Technical Prerequisites

The deployment process requires several technical tools and knowledge areas. You will need access to a local development environment with the following tools installed: AWS CLI version 2.0 or higher, Docker and Docker Compose, Git for version control, and a text editor capable of handling configuration files.

Administrative knowledge of Linux systems is essential, particularly Ubuntu 22.04 LTS which serves as the base operating system for the deployment. Familiarity with PostgreSQL database administration, Nginx web server configuration, and SSL certificate management will be beneficial during the setup process.

Understanding of DNS management and domain configuration is required for setting up the production domain and SSL certificates. Basic knowledge of AWS services including EC2, RDS, S3, and CloudFront will help in understanding the deployment architecture and troubleshooting any issues that arise.

### Domain and SSL Requirements

A registered domain name is required for the production deployment. The domain should be configured to use Route 53 as the DNS provider, or you should have the ability to create CNAME records pointing to AWS resources. The deployment guide assumes you have control over the domain's DNS configuration.

SSL certificates will be provisioned through AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) which provides free SSL certificates for use with AWS services. The domain must be validated through either DNS validation or email validation during the certificate provisioning process.

Consider whether you need multiple subdomains for different services (api.yourdomain.com, widgets.yourdomain.com) and plan your certificate strategy accordingly. Wildcard certificates can simplify management if you plan to use multiple subdomains.

### Security and Compliance Considerations

The deployment includes comprehensive security measures aligned with enterprise requirements and Australian government standards. Review your organization's security policies and compliance requirements before beginning the deployment to ensure all necessary controls are implemented.

Consider whether your organization requires specific security certifications, audit trails, or compliance frameworks. The GrantThrive platform includes built-in support for various compliance standards, but additional configuration may be required based on your specific requirements.

Plan for ongoing security maintenance including regular security updates, vulnerability scanning, and security monitoring. The deployment includes automated security monitoring, but human oversight and response procedures should be established.

### Resource Planning

Estimate your expected user load, data storage requirements, and performance expectations to properly size the AWS resources. The deployment guide provides recommendations for different usage scenarios, but your specific requirements may necessitate adjustments to instance types, storage configurations, or scaling parameters.

Plan for data migration if you are moving from an existing system. The deployment includes tools for data import and export, but complex migrations may require additional planning and testing.

Consider your backup and disaster recovery requirements. The deployment includes automated backup procedures, but your organization may have specific recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO) that require additional configuration.

### Budget and Cost Management

AWS costs can vary significantly based on usage patterns and resource configuration. Review the cost estimation section of this guide and configure billing alerts to monitor expenses during and after deployment.

Consider using AWS Cost Explorer and AWS Budgets to track and manage ongoing costs. The deployment includes recommendations for cost optimization, but regular review and adjustment of resources may be necessary to maintain cost efficiency.

Plan for both initial deployment costs and ongoing operational expenses. Initial costs include data transfer for setup and configuration, while ongoing costs include compute resources, storage, data transfer, and backup storage.


## AWS Infrastructure Setup {#infrastructure}

### VPC and Network Configuration

The GrantThrive deployment utilizes a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to provide network isolation and security. Create a new VPC in the ap-southeast-2 (Sydney) region with a CIDR block of 10.0.0.0/16, which provides approximately 65,000 IP addresses for future scaling requirements.

Configure three availability zones within the Sydney region to ensure high availability and fault tolerance. Each availability zone should contain both public and private subnets. Public subnets (10.0.1.0/24, 10.0.2.0/24, 10.0.3.0/24) will host load balancers and NAT gateways, while private subnets (10.0.11.0/24, 10.0.12.0/24, 10.0.13.0/24) will contain the application servers and database instances.

Create an Internet Gateway and attach it to the VPC to provide internet access for public subnets. Configure NAT Gateways in each public subnet to allow outbound internet access for resources in private subnets while maintaining security by preventing inbound connections from the internet.

Route tables must be configured to direct traffic appropriately. Public subnet route tables should include a route to the Internet Gateway for 0.0.0.0/0 traffic. Private subnet route tables should route internet-bound traffic (0.0.0.0/0) through the NAT Gateway in the corresponding availability zone.

### Security Groups Configuration

Security groups act as virtual firewalls controlling traffic to and from AWS resources. Create dedicated security groups for each tier of the application to implement defense in depth security principles.

The Application Load Balancer security group should allow inbound HTTPS traffic (port 443) from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0) and HTTP traffic (port 80) for redirect purposes. Outbound traffic should be allowed to the application server security group on port 8000 for API communication and port 80 for frontend serving.

Application server security groups should allow inbound traffic from the load balancer security group on ports 8000 (API) and 80 (frontend). SSH access (port 22) should be restricted to specific IP addresses or bastion hosts for administrative access. Outbound traffic should be allowed to the database security group on port 5432 and to the internet for software updates and third-party API calls.

Database security groups should only allow inbound traffic from application servers on port 5432 (PostgreSQL). No direct internet access should be permitted for database instances. Outbound traffic is generally not required for database instances unless specific replication or backup requirements exist.

### EC2 Instance Configuration

Select appropriate EC2 instance types based on expected load and performance requirements. For production deployments, recommend using t3.large instances for the application servers, which provide 2 vCPUs and 8 GB RAM with burstable performance suitable for web applications with variable load patterns.

Configure Auto Scaling Groups to automatically adjust the number of application server instances based on demand. Set minimum capacity to 2 instances for high availability, desired capacity to 2 instances for normal operations, and maximum capacity to 6 instances to handle peak loads.

Launch Template configuration should specify the Ubuntu 22.04 LTS AMI, appropriate instance type, security groups, and user data scripts for automated configuration. Include monitoring and logging agents in the user data to ensure comprehensive observability from instance launch.

Key pair configuration is essential for secure SSH access to instances. Create a new key pair specifically for the GrantThrive deployment and store the private key securely. Consider using AWS Systems Manager Session Manager for secure shell access without requiring direct SSH connections.

### Load Balancer Setup

Application Load Balancer (ALB) provides high availability and distributes incoming traffic across multiple application server instances. Create an internet-facing ALB in the public subnets across all three availability zones to ensure fault tolerance.

Configure target groups for both the API backend (port 8000) and frontend application (port 80). Health checks should be configured to monitor the /health endpoint for the API and the root path for the frontend. Set health check intervals to 30 seconds with a timeout of 5 seconds and require 2 consecutive successful checks before marking an instance as healthy.

Listener configuration should include HTTPS listeners on port 443 with SSL certificates from AWS Certificate Manager. HTTP listeners on port 80 should redirect all traffic to HTTPS to ensure secure communications. Configure listener rules to route API traffic (paths beginning with /api/) to the backend target group and all other traffic to the frontend target group.

Sticky sessions may be required for certain application features. Configure session affinity using application-controlled cookies if needed, but design the application to be stateless where possible to maximize scalability and fault tolerance.

### RDS Database Setup

Amazon RDS provides managed PostgreSQL database services with automated backups, security patches, and high availability options. Create a Multi-AZ RDS instance using PostgreSQL 15 for the latest features and security updates.

Instance sizing should be based on expected database load and storage requirements. For production deployments, recommend starting with db.t3.medium instances (2 vCPUs, 4 GB RAM) with General Purpose SSD storage. Monitor performance metrics and scale up as needed based on actual usage patterns.

Database subnet groups must be configured to span multiple availability zones within the private subnets. This ensures the database can failover to a different availability zone if needed while maintaining network isolation from the internet.

Parameter groups should be customized for optimal PostgreSQL performance. Key parameters to consider include shared_preload_libraries for extensions, max_connections based on expected concurrent users, and work_mem for query performance optimization.

Backup configuration should include automated daily backups with a retention period of at least 7 days for production environments. Consider longer retention periods based on compliance requirements. Point-in-time recovery should be enabled to allow restoration to any point within the backup retention period.

### S3 Storage Configuration

Amazon S3 provides scalable object storage for file uploads, static assets, and backup storage. Create dedicated S3 buckets for different purposes: application file uploads, static asset storage, database backups, and log archival.

Bucket naming should follow a consistent convention such as grantthrive-prod-uploads, grantthrive-prod-static, grantthrive-prod-backups, and grantthrive-prod-logs. Enable versioning on critical buckets to protect against accidental deletion or corruption.

Lifecycle policies should be configured to automatically transition older objects to cheaper storage classes. For example, transition backup files to Infrequent Access storage after 30 days and to Glacier storage after 90 days to optimize costs while maintaining data availability.

Cross-region replication may be required for disaster recovery or compliance purposes. Configure replication to a bucket in a different AWS region to protect against regional outages or disasters.

### CloudFront CDN Setup

Amazon CloudFront provides global content delivery network services to improve performance for users worldwide. Create CloudFront distributions for both static assets and dynamic content to reduce latency and improve user experience.

Static asset distribution should cache CSS, JavaScript, images, and other static files with long cache durations (24 hours or more). Configure appropriate cache behaviors based on file types and update frequencies.

Dynamic content distribution should cache API responses where appropriate while ensuring real-time data is not cached inappropriately. Configure cache behaviors based on URL patterns and HTTP headers to optimize performance while maintaining data freshness.

Origin configuration should point to the Application Load Balancer for dynamic content and S3 buckets for static assets. Configure origin request policies to forward appropriate headers, query strings, and cookies based on application requirements.

### Route 53 DNS Configuration

Amazon Route 53 provides DNS services and domain management. Create hosted zones for your domain and configure DNS records to point to the CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancer.

A records should point the root domain and www subdomain to the CloudFront distribution for the frontend application. CNAME records should be created for api.yourdomain.com pointing to the Application Load Balancer and widgets.yourdomain.com for the widget system.

Health checks can be configured to monitor the availability of your application endpoints and automatically failover to backup systems if needed. Configure health checks for critical endpoints and set up notifications for health check failures.

TTL values should be set appropriately for different record types. Use shorter TTL values (300 seconds) for records that may need to change quickly and longer TTL values (3600 seconds) for stable records to improve DNS resolution performance.


## Security Configuration {#security}

### IAM Roles and Policies

Identity and Access Management (IAM) provides the foundation for secure access control throughout the GrantThrive deployment. Create dedicated IAM roles for different components of the system to implement the principle of least privilege and ensure each service has only the permissions necessary for its function.

The EC2 instance role should include permissions for CloudWatch logging, S3 access for file uploads and backups, Systems Manager for remote management, and Parameter Store access for configuration management. Avoid using overly broad permissions such as full S3 access; instead, scope permissions to specific buckets and operations required by the application.

Database access should be managed through IAM database authentication where possible, supplemented by traditional username and password authentication for compatibility. Create database users with minimal required privileges and use connection pooling to manage database connections efficiently.

Service-linked roles should be created for AWS services such as Auto Scaling, Load Balancing, and RDS to allow these services to perform necessary operations on your behalf. These roles are typically created automatically when services are configured, but review the permissions to ensure they align with your security requirements.

Cross-account access may be required if you use separate AWS accounts for different environments or if third-party services need access to specific resources. Configure cross-account roles with appropriate trust policies and permission boundaries to maintain security while enabling necessary integrations.

### Network Security

Network security forms a critical layer of defense for the GrantThrive platform. Implement network segmentation using VPC subnets and security groups to isolate different tiers of the application and limit the blast radius of potential security incidents.

Web Application Firewall (WAF) should be deployed in front of the Application Load Balancer to protect against common web application attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and DDoS attacks. Configure WAF rules to block malicious traffic patterns while allowing legitimate user traffic.

VPC Flow Logs should be enabled to capture network traffic metadata for security monitoring and forensic analysis. Configure flow logs to capture all traffic (accepted and rejected) and store logs in CloudWatch Logs or S3 for analysis.

Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) provide an additional layer of network security at the subnet level. While security groups provide stateful filtering at the instance level, NACLs provide stateless filtering that can block traffic before it reaches security groups.

Private connectivity options such as VPC Endpoints should be configured for AWS services to avoid routing traffic over the public internet. Create VPC endpoints for S3, CloudWatch, and other AWS services used by the application to improve security and reduce data transfer costs.

### Encryption Configuration

Encryption at rest and in transit is essential for protecting sensitive data throughout the GrantThrive platform. Configure encryption for all data storage and transmission points to ensure comprehensive data protection.

RDS encryption should be enabled using AWS KMS keys to protect database data at rest. Choose between AWS managed keys for simplicity or customer managed keys for additional control over key rotation and access policies. Ensure that automated backups and read replicas are also encrypted.

S3 bucket encryption should be configured using server-side encryption with KMS keys. Enable default encryption for all buckets to ensure that objects are automatically encrypted when uploaded. Consider using bucket keys to reduce KMS costs for high-volume uploads.

EBS volume encryption should be enabled for all EC2 instances to protect data stored on instance storage. Use the default AWS managed key for simplicity or create customer managed keys if specific key management requirements exist.

Application-level encryption should be implemented for sensitive data fields such as personally identifiable information (PII) and financial data. Use strong encryption algorithms and proper key management practices to ensure data remains protected even if other security controls fail.

SSL/TLS configuration must use strong cipher suites and current protocol versions. Disable older protocols such as TLS 1.0 and 1.1, and configure cipher suites to prefer forward secrecy and strong encryption algorithms. Use tools such as SSL Labs to validate SSL configuration.

### Access Control and Authentication

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) should be required for all administrative access to AWS resources and the GrantThrive application. Configure MFA for AWS root account access, IAM users with administrative privileges, and application administrators.

Single Sign-On (SSO) integration allows users to access GrantThrive using their existing organizational credentials. Configure AWS SSO or integrate with external identity providers such as Active Directory, Azure AD, or Google Workspace to streamline user management and improve security.

Role-based access control (RBAC) within the GrantThrive application should be configured to match your organizational structure and security requirements. Define roles with appropriate permissions and regularly review role assignments to ensure users have appropriate access levels.

Session management should include appropriate timeout values, secure session storage, and session invalidation upon logout or suspicious activity. Configure session cookies with secure and HttpOnly flags to prevent client-side access and transmission over insecure connections.

API authentication should use strong authentication mechanisms such as OAuth 2.0 or JWT tokens with appropriate expiration times. Implement rate limiting and request throttling to prevent abuse and protect against denial-of-service attacks.

### Monitoring and Alerting

Security monitoring provides visibility into potential threats and security incidents. Configure comprehensive monitoring and alerting to detect and respond to security events in real-time.

CloudTrail should be enabled to log all API calls and administrative actions across your AWS account. Configure CloudTrail to deliver logs to S3 and CloudWatch Logs for analysis and alerting. Enable log file integrity validation to detect tampering.

GuardDuty provides intelligent threat detection using machine learning and threat intelligence. Enable GuardDuty to monitor for malicious activity, compromised instances, and data exfiltration attempts. Configure notifications for high-severity findings.

Security Hub aggregates security findings from multiple AWS security services and provides a centralized dashboard for security posture management. Enable Security Hub and configure integrations with other security tools for comprehensive visibility.

CloudWatch alarms should be configured for security-relevant metrics such as failed login attempts, unusual API activity, and resource utilization spikes that might indicate attacks. Set up notifications to security teams for immediate response to potential incidents.

Application-level logging should capture security events such as authentication attempts, authorization failures, and data access patterns. Configure log aggregation and analysis tools to identify patterns that might indicate security threats.

### Compliance and Auditing

Compliance frameworks such as SOC 2, ISO 27001, and Australian Privacy Principles require specific security controls and audit capabilities. Configure the GrantThrive deployment to support compliance requirements relevant to your organization.

Audit trails should capture all user actions, system changes, and data access events. Configure comprehensive logging across all system components and ensure logs are tamper-evident and stored securely for the required retention period.

Data classification and handling procedures should be implemented based on the sensitivity of data stored in GrantThrive. Identify and classify different types of data (public, internal, confidential, restricted) and implement appropriate protection measures for each classification level.

Regular security assessments including vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, and security reviews should be conducted to identify and remediate security weaknesses. Schedule assessments based on compliance requirements and risk tolerance.

Incident response procedures should be documented and tested regularly to ensure effective response to security incidents. Define roles and responsibilities, communication procedures, and technical response steps for different types of security events.

### Backup and Recovery Security

Backup security ensures that backup data is protected with the same rigor as production data. Configure encryption for all backup data and implement access controls to prevent unauthorized access to backup systems.

Backup integrity verification should be performed regularly to ensure backups can be successfully restored when needed. Implement automated testing of backup restoration procedures and document recovery time objectives and recovery point objectives.

Cross-region backup replication provides protection against regional disasters and ensures business continuity. Configure automated replication of critical backups to a secondary AWS region with appropriate security controls.

Backup retention policies should align with compliance requirements and business needs. Implement automated lifecycle management to transition older backups to cheaper storage classes while maintaining required retention periods.

Access logging for backup systems should capture all access to backup data and restoration activities. Monitor backup access patterns for unusual activity that might indicate unauthorized access or data exfiltration attempts.


## Database Deployment {#database}

### PostgreSQL RDS Instance Setup

The GrantThrive platform requires a robust PostgreSQL database deployment capable of handling enterprise-scale workloads with high availability and performance. Amazon RDS provides managed PostgreSQL services that eliminate the operational overhead of database administration while providing enterprise-grade features.

Begin by creating a DB subnet group that spans multiple availability zones within your VPC's private subnets. This configuration ensures that the database can automatically failover to a different availability zone in case of hardware failure or maintenance events. The subnet group should include subnets from at least two availability zones in the Sydney region.

Select PostgreSQL version 15 or later for the latest performance improvements and security features. The engine version should be kept current with regular minor version updates to ensure security patches and bug fixes are applied promptly. Configure automatic minor version upgrades to reduce maintenance overhead while maintaining security.

Instance class selection depends on expected workload characteristics and performance requirements. For production deployments, start with db.t3.medium instances (2 vCPUs, 4 GB RAM) for moderate workloads or db.m5.large instances (2 vCPUs, 8 GB RAM) for higher performance requirements. Monitor CPU utilization, memory usage, and I/O metrics to determine if instance scaling is needed.

Storage configuration should use General Purpose SSD (gp3) storage for balanced performance and cost. Allocate initial storage based on expected data growth, typically starting with 100 GB for new deployments. Enable storage autoscaling to automatically increase storage capacity as data grows, preventing storage full conditions that could impact application availability.

Multi-AZ deployment is essential for production environments to provide high availability and automatic failover capabilities. Multi-AZ configuration maintains a synchronous standby replica in a different availability zone and automatically fails over to the standby in case of primary instance failure, typically completing failover within 60-120 seconds.

### Database Security Configuration

Database security requires multiple layers of protection to ensure data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Configure comprehensive security controls at the network, authentication, and encryption levels to protect sensitive grant management data.

Network isolation should place the RDS instance in private subnets with no direct internet access. Configure security groups to allow connections only from application server security groups on port 5432. Implement additional network controls such as NACLs if required by security policies.

Encryption at rest should be enabled using AWS KMS encryption keys to protect data stored on disk. Choose between AWS managed keys for simplicity or customer managed keys for additional control over key rotation and access policies. Ensure that automated backups, read replicas, and snapshots are also encrypted.

Encryption in transit should be enforced by configuring the RDS instance to require SSL connections. Update the PostgreSQL configuration to set ssl = on and require SSL for all client connections. Configure the application to use SSL when connecting to the database.

Database authentication should use strong passwords and consider implementing IAM database authentication for additional security. Create dedicated database users for the application with minimal required privileges. Avoid using the master user for application connections.

Parameter group configuration should include security-relevant settings such as log_statement to log all SQL statements, log_connections to log connection attempts, and shared_preload_libraries to load required extensions. Review all parameter settings to ensure they align with security requirements.

### Database Schema Deployment

Database schema deployment involves creating the initial database structure, loading reference data, and configuring database-specific features required by the GrantThrive application. Use the provided migration scripts to ensure consistent and repeatable deployments.

Connect to the RDS instance using the provided database setup script to create the initial database structure. The script creates the application database, user accounts, and required PostgreSQL extensions such as uuid-ossp for UUID generation and pg_trgm for text search functionality.

Execute the database setup SQL script to create the foundational database objects including schemas for audit logging, monitoring, and backup operations. These schemas provide the infrastructure for comprehensive audit trails and operational monitoring required for enterprise deployments.

Run Alembic migrations to create the application-specific database schema including tables for users, grants, applications, organizations, and all other GrantThrive entities. The migration process is idempotent and can be safely re-run if needed.

Verify schema deployment by checking that all expected tables, indexes, and constraints have been created correctly. Use the provided verification queries to ensure database integrity and proper configuration of foreign key relationships.

Configure database extensions required by the application including uuid-ossp for UUID generation, pg_trgm for full-text search capabilities, and unaccent for text normalization. These extensions enhance application functionality and performance.

### Performance Optimization

Database performance optimization ensures that the GrantThrive platform can handle expected user loads with acceptable response times. Implement performance monitoring and optimization strategies from the initial deployment to establish baseline performance metrics.

Connection pooling should be configured to manage database connections efficiently and prevent connection exhaustion under high load. Configure the application to use connection pooling with appropriate pool sizes based on expected concurrent users and application server capacity.

Index optimization involves creating appropriate indexes for common query patterns while avoiding over-indexing that could impact write performance. Monitor query performance using PostgreSQL's query statistics and create indexes for frequently executed queries with high execution times.

Query optimization should focus on identifying and improving slow-running queries that impact user experience. Use PostgreSQL's slow query log and query statistics to identify problematic queries and optimize them through query rewriting, index creation, or schema modifications.

Memory configuration should be tuned based on available instance memory and workload characteristics. Key parameters include shared_buffers (typically 25% of available memory), work_mem for sort operations, and maintenance_work_mem for maintenance operations such as index creation.

Autovacuum configuration should be tuned to maintain optimal database performance by automatically cleaning up dead tuples and updating table statistics. Monitor autovacuum activity and adjust parameters such as autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor and autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor based on workload patterns.

### Backup and Recovery Configuration

Comprehensive backup and recovery procedures ensure business continuity and data protection for the GrantThrive platform. Configure multiple backup strategies to provide protection against different types of data loss scenarios.

Automated backups should be enabled with a retention period of at least 7 days for production environments. Consider longer retention periods based on compliance requirements and business needs. Automated backups provide point-in-time recovery capabilities within the retention period.

Manual snapshots should be created before major application updates, schema changes, or other significant modifications. Manual snapshots are retained until explicitly deleted and provide recovery points for specific events or milestones.

Cross-region backup replication provides protection against regional disasters and ensures business continuity. Configure automated copying of snapshots to a secondary AWS region, typically Melbourne (ap-southeast-4) for geographic diversity within Australia.

Backup testing should be performed regularly to verify that backups can be successfully restored when needed. Implement automated testing procedures that restore backups to test environments and validate data integrity and application functionality.

Recovery procedures should be documented and tested to ensure rapid recovery in case of data loss or corruption. Define recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO) based on business requirements and configure backup strategies to meet these objectives.

### Monitoring and Alerting

Database monitoring provides visibility into performance, availability, and security events that could impact the GrantThrive platform. Configure comprehensive monitoring and alerting to proactively identify and resolve database issues.

CloudWatch metrics should be monitored for key database performance indicators including CPU utilization, memory usage, disk I/O, and connection count. Set up alarms for metrics that exceed acceptable thresholds and configure notifications to database administrators.

Enhanced monitoring should be enabled to provide detailed operating system metrics from the RDS instance. Enhanced monitoring provides insights into CPU, memory, file system, and network performance that can help identify performance bottlenecks.

Performance Insights provides query-level performance monitoring and analysis capabilities. Enable Performance Insights to identify slow-running queries, resource contention, and optimization opportunities. Configure retention periods based on monitoring requirements.

Database logs should be configured to capture important events such as connections, disconnections, errors, and slow queries. Enable log exports to CloudWatch Logs for centralized log analysis and alerting on specific log events.

Custom metrics should be created for application-specific monitoring requirements such as user activity levels, grant application volumes, and business-critical operations. Use CloudWatch custom metrics to track these application-level indicators.

### Maintenance and Updates

Regular maintenance ensures optimal database performance, security, and reliability. Establish maintenance procedures and schedules to keep the database system current and performing optimally.

Maintenance windows should be scheduled during low-usage periods to minimize impact on users. Configure automatic minor version updates to apply security patches and bug fixes promptly while scheduling major version upgrades during planned maintenance windows.

Parameter group updates may be required to optimize performance or implement security improvements. Test parameter changes in non-production environments before applying to production systems and monitor performance after changes.

Security updates should be applied promptly to address vulnerabilities and maintain security posture. Subscribe to AWS security bulletins and PostgreSQL security announcements to stay informed about available updates.

Performance tuning should be an ongoing process based on monitoring data and changing usage patterns. Regularly review performance metrics, query statistics, and user feedback to identify optimization opportunities.

Capacity planning should anticipate future growth and ensure adequate resources are available to meet increasing demands. Monitor storage usage, connection counts, and performance metrics to predict when scaling actions will be needed.


## Application Deployment {#application}

### Backend API Deployment

The GrantThrive backend API serves as the core engine powering all platform functionality including grant management, user authentication, community features, and third-party integrations. The deployment process involves configuring the Flask application for production use with appropriate security, performance, and monitoring capabilities.

Configure database connection strings to point to the RDS PostgreSQL instance, ensuring SSL connections are enabled for security. Set up Redis connection parameters for session management and caching, using ElastiCache for managed Redis services in production.

Environment variables should include all necessary configuration parameters such as secret keys, API credentials for third-party integrations, email service configuration, and feature flags. Use AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store or AWS Secrets Manager to securely store sensitive configuration values and reference them in the application configuration.

Docker containerization provides consistent deployment environments and simplifies application management. Build the Docker image using the provided Dockerfile, which includes all necessary dependencies, security updates, and application code. Tag images with version numbers and commit hashes for traceability and rollback capabilities.

Container orchestration can be implemented using Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) for managed container deployment or directly on EC2 instances using Docker Compose. ECS provides automatic scaling, health monitoring, and service discovery capabilities that simplify production operations.

Application server configuration should use Gunicorn as the WSGI server for production deployments. The provided gunicorn.conf.py file includes optimized settings for worker processes, connection handling, and logging. Configure worker count based on available CPU cores and expected load patterns.

Load balancer health checks should be configured to monitor the /health endpoint provided by the Flask application. The health check endpoint verifies database connectivity, Redis availability, and overall application health. Configure appropriate timeout and retry parameters to avoid false positives during high load periods.

### Service Configuration

System services ensure that the GrantThrive application starts automatically and remains running even after system restarts or failures. Configure systemd services for reliable application lifecycle management.

Create systemd service files for the backend API service that specify the working directory, environment variables, user account, and restart policies. Configure the service to restart automatically on failure and to start after network and database services are available.

Log management should be configured to capture application logs, error messages, and audit trails. Use structured logging formats such as JSON to facilitate log analysis and monitoring. Configure log rotation to prevent disk space exhaustion while maintaining adequate log retention for troubleshooting and compliance.

Process monitoring should be implemented using tools such as supervisord or systemd to ensure application processes remain running and restart automatically if they crash. Configure monitoring to send alerts when processes fail or restart unexpectedly.

Resource limits should be configured to prevent individual processes from consuming excessive system resources. Use systemd resource controls or container limits to restrict memory usage, CPU utilization, and file descriptor limits based on system capacity and expected load.

Environment isolation should be maintained using dedicated user accounts for application processes. Create non-privileged user accounts specifically for running GrantThrive services and configure appropriate file permissions and access controls.

### Database Integration

Database integration involves configuring the application to connect securely and efficiently to the PostgreSQL RDS instance. Implement connection pooling, error handling, and performance optimization to ensure reliable database operations.

Connection pooling should be configured using SQLAlchemy's connection pool settings to manage database connections efficiently. Configure pool size, overflow limits, and connection recycling parameters based on expected concurrent users and database capacity.

Connection security should enforce SSL connections to the database and validate server certificates to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. Configure the application to use SSL certificates and verify the database server identity during connection establishment.

Error handling should include comprehensive exception handling for database connection failures, query timeouts, and constraint violations. Implement retry logic for transient failures and graceful degradation for non-critical operations when database connectivity is impaired.

Query optimization should be implemented through proper use of database indexes, query caching, and efficient query patterns. Monitor query performance using application performance monitoring tools and database query statistics to identify optimization opportunities.

Migration management should use Alembic for database schema changes and version control. Implement automated migration procedures that can be safely executed during deployment without causing downtime or data loss.

### Third-Party Integration Configuration

GrantThrive includes comprehensive third-party integrations for financial systems, CRM platforms, document management, and communication tools. Configure these integrations securely and reliably for production use.

API credentials for third-party services should be stored securely using AWS Secrets Manager or Systems Manager Parameter Store. Implement credential rotation procedures and monitor for credential expiration or revocation.

Rate limiting should be implemented for all third-party API calls to prevent exceeding service limits and avoid service disruptions. Configure appropriate retry logic with exponential backoff for failed API calls and implement circuit breaker patterns for unreliable services.

Webhook handling should be configured for real-time integration updates from third-party services. Implement webhook verification to ensure authenticity of incoming requests and configure appropriate error handling for webhook processing failures.

Integration monitoring should track the health and performance of all third-party integrations. Monitor API response times, error rates, and data synchronization status to identify integration issues before they impact users.

Fallback procedures should be implemented for critical integrations to ensure application functionality when third-party services are unavailable. Design graceful degradation strategies that maintain core functionality while third-party services are restored.

### Performance Optimization

Application performance optimization ensures that GrantThrive can handle expected user loads with acceptable response times and resource utilization. Implement caching, optimization, and monitoring strategies to maintain optimal performance.

Caching strategies should be implemented at multiple levels including database query caching, API response caching, and static asset caching. Use Redis for application-level caching and configure appropriate cache expiration policies based on data volatility.

Database query optimization should focus on efficient query patterns, proper index usage, and connection management. Use database query analysis tools to identify slow queries and implement optimizations such as query rewriting or index creation.
