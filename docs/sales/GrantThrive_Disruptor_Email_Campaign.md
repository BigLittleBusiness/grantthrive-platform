## Email Templates

### Email 1: The Provocation

**Subject: Is your grants software holding [Council Name] back?**

Hi [First Name],

My name is [Your Name], and I specialize in helping Australian councils maximize the impact of their community funding.

I was reviewing [Council Name]'s strategic plan and was impressed by your commitment to [mention a specific goal, e.g., "digital transformation" or "enhancing community wellbeing"].

This led me to a question I often discuss with council leaders: Is your current grant management software actively helping you achieve these goals, or is it unintentionally creating a drag on staff time and a frustrating experience for your community applicants?

Many councils are finding that older systems, like SmartyGrants, are costing them hundreds of hours in hidden administrative overhead and preventing them from accessing the data they need to make truly strategic funding decisions.

Is ensuring your technology drives efficiency and impact a priority for you in 2025?

All the best,

### Email 2: The Value Proposition

**Subject: More impact, less budget for [Council Name]**
*Send 3 days after Email 1 if no reply*

Hi [First Name],

Following up on my previous email about grant management efficiency.

In the current climate, every dollar in your budget is critical. What if you could deliver a significantly better grant management experience to your community and your staff, and do it for **15-20% less** than your current annual cost?

GrantThrive is a modern, AI-powered grant management platform that is helping councils across Australia to:

✅ **Cut administrative time by over 50%** through intelligent automation
✅ **Increase community engagement** with a simple, mobile-friendly application process  
✅ **Gain powerful insights** into funding distribution and community impact with real-time analytics
✅ **Save money** with transparent pricing that's 15-20% below market rates

We're not just offering a replacement system – we're offering a superior platform that actually *reduces* your operational spending while delivering better outcomes.

Would you be open to a brief 15-minute call next week to see how this could work for [Council Name]? I can show you exactly how other councils are achieving these results.

Regards,

### Email 3: The Social Proof & Call to Action

**Subject: A quick question about your grant management**
*Send 4 days after Email 2 if no reply*

Hi [First Name],

I know you're incredibly busy, so I'll keep this brief.

The reason I'm being persistent is that we're consistently hearing from council staff across Australia that their current grants system is a major source of frustration. Comments like:

• "It takes forever to process applications"
• "The reporting is terrible" 
• "Our community groups find it confusing"
• "We can't get the data we need for strategic decisions"

We've built the solution to these exact problems. It's more powerful, more intuitive, and more cost-effective than what most councils are currently using.

**Simple question:** Can you or a relevant member of your team spare 15 minutes for a conversation that could save your council thousands of dollars and hundreds of staff hours next year?

If grant management isn't your area, who would be the best person to speak to regarding community funding operations at [Council Name]?

Thanks for your time and consideration.

Best,

[Your Name]
